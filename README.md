# Project 1 - Top Flicks

Flicks is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

## How to Run

1. Open up Top Flicks.xcworkspace
2. Run the app on your phone or a simulator

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [✔] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [✔] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [✔] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [✔] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How to pass information between view controllers
2. Errors regarding the didSelectRow function

## Notes

My main struggles came with displaying the information on another view controller to allow for easier viewing once the user selects a movie on the table view, but unfortunately, I was unable to implement this functionality.
